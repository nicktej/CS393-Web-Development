# CS393-Web-Development
This repository contains projects and labs I worked on for my Web Dev class at Lewis &amp; Clark College.
Languages used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL.
Projects include simple static websites, a fifteen puzzle game, speed reader, dynamic webpage, and database.

The fifteen puzzle game is a neat little game that when completed, shows a picture of a man.

The speed reader allows the user to input a text, of which individual words will be displayed at their desired speed.

The bestreads lab is a lab that showcases various books, along with additional information such as reviews, summary, images, etc.

The database uses the small IMDB resource, which allowed me to search for people related to Kevin Bacon (starred in similar films), or just search actors/actresses in general.

## Getting Started

If you're interested, all you have to do is fork the repo and enjoy!

### Prerequisites

For labs 5 and 6, you'll need to be able to host it, like on codeeverywhere or c9. I used c9, which is currently owned by Amazon.
